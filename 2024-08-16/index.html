<h1>Cake</h1>
    <p><strong>Cake is a form of <em>sweet food</em> made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked.</strong> In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</p>
    <h2>Varieties</h2>
    <h3>Gooey butter cake</h3>
    <p>Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter.</p>
    <h3>Steamed sponge cake</h3>
    <p>Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added.</p>
